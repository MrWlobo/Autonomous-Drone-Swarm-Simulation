# Autonomous-Drone-Swarm-Simulation

## Introduction
Our aim is to develop an environment to simulate swarms of drones performing package delivery tasks on a 2D hexagonal grid. The main goal is to implement various strategies of cooperation between drones so that they complete their mission as efficiently as possible while avoiding running into obstacles or eachother. Then, those approaches will be compared based on stats such as time required to make a delivery or overall energy used during the process.
