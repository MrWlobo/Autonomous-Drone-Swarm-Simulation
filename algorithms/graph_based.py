# IDEA
# 1. Create a graph with vertices being the hubs and drop zones and
#    edges being the shortest paths between two given points.
#    The edges should consider the terrain shape while calculating
#    the best path.
#
# 2. Calculate the energy cost of following the given path by a given drone (different
#    weights of the cargo will result in varying energy loses).
#
# 3. Use an algorithm (Dijkstra, A* etc.) to find the shortest path from drone's hub to
#    the drop zone.
#
# 4A. If drone is able to make the journey to drop zone and back to the hub without its
#     battery life dropping below a safe_battery_level (a variable chosen by user at the
#     beginning of the simulation) it goes using the shortest path.
#
# 4B. If drone is unable to make it, the algorithm searches for the best available path
#     (one leading through hubs where drone can recharge), which is then assigned to the
#     drone. It then uses the chargers on its way to get back to a comfortable energy level.
#
# 4C. If the package is unreachable (eg. cost of getting to it from the nearest hub and back
#     is > 100% of drone;s battery life) the task is discarded and a new one is assigned.
#
# 5. Drone comes back to the nearest hub that still has packages, gets assigned a new task and
#    recharges enough to perform it.
#
# 6. After all deliveries were made, the drones return to the nearest hub and go into rest mode.
#    When they all do so, the simulation ends.
